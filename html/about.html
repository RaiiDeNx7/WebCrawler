        <h1>About Food Deserts</h1>
        <p style="color:white;font-size: 24px;text-align: center;">A "food desert" refers to an area where residents have limited access to affordable and nutritious food, often due to the lack of supermarkets or grocery stores, leading to potential health issues and food insecurity.
            Food deserts tend to be inhabited by low-income residents with inadequate access to transportation, which makes them less attractive markets for large supermarket chains. These areas lack suppliers of fresh foods, such as meats, fruits, and vegetables. </p>
